20 Rare Words to Fascinate and Delight


Many words have gone out of fashion because they have lost their utility and become inapplicable in the 21st century.

We no longer make reference to our baldrics because it would be difficult to find someone who still carries a bag of horns and swords slung over one shoulder.

Other rare or infrequently-used words pertain to fields like psychology – the phobias and philias, for example – as well as biology, astronomy, botany, and many others, and though they intimately describe the more technical aspects of our lives, it is their very specificity that relegates them to colloquial obscurity.

There are some rare words, however, that still tickle the ear and amuse the mind. Though these words are not heard on a regular basis, the list below includes 20 of the most fascinating and useful obscure words of the English language:
